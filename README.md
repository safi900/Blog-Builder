# Blog-Builder Prototype
I run a very manual blog (yes, on purpose) and recently decided to create separate pages for each of my posts. Rather than write all the html for the pages myself, I want to write a program that features an interface, where I can input the date, the blog post title/subject, and the actual text. The idea is to get the program to write the code for the pages using the input info to fill in variables in the output code.

I've written a simple python program (four lines of code) that asks for the date, subject heading and blog text, and which outputs the html code that will display the blogpost.

The next version will be able to output the code for a whole page, as opposed to just the code for the blogpost.
